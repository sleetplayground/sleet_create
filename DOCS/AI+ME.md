Step 1

Create a simple three page website, following the SLEET_DESIGN.md
The index file should have large button links to to the pages.
Footer should have links to all pages.
Other than that ther will be no menu.

    ├── css
    │   └── index.css
    ├── index.html
    ├── js
    └── pages
        ├── account.html
        └── sub.html

Step 2 add elements to the account html

We need to have something that resembles a form
- we will need a text input
- and then a button that says create
- we will also need a connect wallet button
- and then a button or toggle switch for toggling between testnet and mainnet, will add funinality to that later
- will also need a save button

 the wallet connect and network toggle button can be at the top, then text input and create button, then save button
